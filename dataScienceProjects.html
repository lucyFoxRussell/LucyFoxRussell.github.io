            <div class="style60" style="padding-left: 50px;">
              <p>As part of a group project we were presented a scenario of a user who needed to be able to use an application that by inputting in a time and location of an incident would be presented back with who was known to have been in the area at this time.  As part of this project we were given lots of CSV files containing lots of dummy data including, names, addresses, call records, ATM and card transitions and vehicle registration sightings.       </p>
              <p>We chose to use React for the frontend, Node.js and SQL for backend and deploy on AWS. My main focus was on Node.js and querying the database which took a lot of time and effort to get from the original data format onto a database and in a way that could be used on a relational database. We also used a Map API to take the coordinates returned from the backend to display the locations of activities on a map for the user to be able to easily interpret the data. This was a really enjoyable project and I learnt a lot from various aspects of development.       </p>
              <p>To try out the tool you can use the example data Latitude: 52.70225113709832 Longitude: -2.0368518763076935 and Date and Time: 01/05/2015 09:08 as this is known to have relevant data associated with it in the database.  </p
